# Conversion performance

The `conversion` benchmark performs 32,768 records per scan using single-step ATIF trajectories, including the complete nested Arrow schema. Fixture creation is outside the timed region. Arrow batches are flushed every 1,024 rows where applicable; output is consumed through `black_box`.

```sh
cargo bench -p atif-arrow --bench conversion -- ignored 3
```

The positional arguments are an unused case label and the scan iteration count. Build once with `--no-run` and run the printed executable directly to exclude Cargo startup. The executable prints JSON with elapsed time, iterations, input size and record count. This is a deterministic allocation-sensitive workload, not a representative corpus or a CI performance threshold.

For a controlled comparison against `dd89a05`, copy only the benchmark file and its `[[bench]]` manifest entry onto that base; leave production sources unchanged. Build release executables for both trees with the same toolchain and lockfile. Warm both executables, alternate baseline/candidate processes, and compare elapsed seconds per scan.

Measured evidence and independent optimization comparisons are linked from the open-arrow-access benchmark report.

On the local Apple Silicon release build (Rust 1.97.0), ten alternating measured processes per variant gave median scan times **206.873 → 184.347 ms**, or **1.12× throughput** for this workload. The earlier warm-up processes were excluded. These are native conversion measurements; they do not include storage or the open-arrow-access adapter.

Raw samples and the process comparison script are included in [open-arrow-access PR #168](https://github.com/dentiny/open-arrow-access/pull/168), under `benchmarks/results/2026-11-09-main32e6805/`.
